This project is an interactive Rock Paper Scissors game developed using Python’s Tkinter library as part of my internship at Codsoft.

Project Overview

The game allows users to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer with an engaging graphical interface. It features clickable buttons for user choices, displays images representing the selections, and keeps track of scores to determine the winner.

How to Use

Run the script to open the game window. Click one of the "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissor" buttons to make a choice. The computer’s choice and game result will immediately display, along with the updated scores.
