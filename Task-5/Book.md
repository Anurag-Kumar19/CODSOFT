This project is a Contact Book desktop application developed using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library during my internship at Codsoft.

Project Overview

The application enables users to manage contacts efficiently with an easy-to-use graphical interface. Users can add, view, search, update, and delete contacts, each containing details like name, mobile number, email, and address.

How to Use

Run the script to open the contact book window. Enter contact details and use buttons to add, update, or delete contacts. Use the search box to find contacts quickly. View all contacts anytime with a dedicated button.
