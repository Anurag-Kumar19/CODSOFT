This project is a Password Generator desktop application developed using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library during my internship at Codsoft.

Project Overview

The application generates strong, random passwords based on the desired length specified by the user. It combines letters, numbers, and special symbols to create secure passwords instantly.

How to Use

Run the script to open the application window. Enter the desired password length and click the "Generate Password" button. The generated password will appear below, ready to be copied and used securely.
