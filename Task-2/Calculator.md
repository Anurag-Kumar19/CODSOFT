This project is a Calculator desktop application built using Python's Tkinter library as part of my internship at Codsoft.

Project Overview

The calculator provides a user-friendly graphical interface allowing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes essential functions such as clear, backspace, and result evaluation in real time.

Key Features

Intuitive button layout for digits and operations

Clear ("C") button to reset the display

Backspace ("⌫") to delete the last entered character

Real-time calculation with error handling for invalid expressions

Responsive design that adapts to window resizing

How to Use

Run the script to open the calculator window. Click the buttons to input numbers and operations. The display shows the current entry or result. Use "=" to calculate, "C" to clear, and "⌫" to delete the last input.
