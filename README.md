The To-Do List app GUI features a clear, modern interface with a titled header, input field, list display, and simple Add/Delete buttons for easy task management.


How It Works
Enter a task in the text field and click "Add Task" to append the item to the list with its own number.

Select any task from the displayed list and click "Delete Task" to remove it instantly.

The interface updates dynamically, allowing seamless task management throughout the session
